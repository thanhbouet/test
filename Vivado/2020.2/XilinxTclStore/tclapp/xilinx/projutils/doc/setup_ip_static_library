Description:

  Retrieve static simulation files for IPs from the current project or the Xilinx IP catalog and setup
  source library for compile_simlib. The compile_simlib tcl task will use this library for compiling the
  IP files for the specified simulator.

Arguments:

  -directory - (Optional) Directory path where the static files will be extracted. By default, if this switch
               is not specified then this command will extract the files in "ipstatic" directory in the
               current directory.
  
  -ip_repo_path - (Optional) Extract static files from the specified IP repository. By default, the static
                  files will be extracted from the installed IP repository.

  -ips - (Optional) - Extract static files for the specified IP only

  -project - (Optional) Extract static files for the current project

  -install - (Optional) Extract static files for the installed IP repository

  -no_update_catalog - (Optional) - Donot update IP catalog

  -force - (Optional) - Overwrite static file directory

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, ignoring any command line errors and returning no
  messages. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors encountered during execution.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following command will extract static files for the installed IP repository in '/my_project/static_lib' directory:-

  % setup_ip_static_library -directory /my_project/static_lib

  The following command will extract static files from '/my_project/ip_repo' and export them into ./ipstatic directory:-

  % setup_ip_static_library -ip_repo_path /my_project/ip_repo

  The following command will extract static files for the 'char_fifo' IP into ./ipstatic directory:-

  % setup_ip_static_library -ips [get_ips char_fifo]

  The following command will extract static files for all the IPs in the current project in ./ipstatic directory:-

  % setup_ip_static_library -project

  The following command will extract static files for all the installed IP repository in ./ipstatic directory:-

  % setup_ip_static_library -install

  The following command will extract static files for all the installed IP repository in ./ipstatic directory and
  will not update the IP catalog:-

  % setup_ip_static_library -install -no_update_catolog
