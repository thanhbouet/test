Description:

  Runs synthesis for a Block Design (BD), integrates the design along with any
  needed sub-designs (e.g. OOC synthesized IP), and writes out a single design
  checkpoint of the entire synthesized design along with HDL stub files for
  use in other synthesis tools. The output files will be placed in the same
  directory as the source BD file.

Arguments:

  -help - (Optional) Print this help.

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite existing design checkpoint and stub files

  -verbose - (Optional) Print verbose messaging.

  -keep - (Optional) Keep temporary directory and project after export_bd_checkpoint has finished.

  <file> - (Required) The Block Design file to write a synthesized checkpoint for

Syntax:

  export_bd_synth [-help] [-force] [-verbose] [-keep] <file>

Returns:

  (none) An error will be thrown if the command is not successful.

Examples:

  The following command will generate a synthesis checkpoint along with stub
  files for the block_1.bd.

  % export_bd_synth [get_files block_1.bd]
